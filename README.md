# WordtoPDF
In this repository there is a file (Macro.txt) that when used in vba it lets you select a word document,
choose a page to start extracting information,
choose a number of pages to extract,
turn those pages into pdf,
repeat.
When you extracted all the pages you needed, write 0 to stop the loop.

I did this code as I couldn't find myself a solution on the web, so I hope other people that have the same problem, can use it without problems.
